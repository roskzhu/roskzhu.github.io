## Project Overview
#### Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This website serves as a showcase of my skills and projects. It is built using React and TailwindCSS. It also serves as a platform for me to share my contact information and links to my social media profiles. The portfolio is meant to showcase my work as a software developer, making it easier for potential employers, collaborators, or clients to get to know me and my work.
## File Structure
#### **src/components:** This directory contains all the React components used to build the website. Each component is responsible for rendering a specific section of the portfolio, such as the header, about me, projects, and contact.
#### **src/assets:** This directory stores static assets used in the project, including images, icons, and fonts.
#### **src/App.js:** The main entry point of the application. It imports and renders all the components that make up the portfolio website.
#### **public/index.html:** The HTML template for the website. It includes the root element where the React application is mounted and links to external resources like fonts and icons.
#### **package.json:** This file lists the project's dependencies and scripts. It's used by Node.js to manage and build the project.
#### **README.md:** You're currently reading it! This file provides documentation for the project.
## Design Choices
#### React for Building the Portfolio
#### I chose to build my portfolio using React because of its component-based architecture, which makes it easy to manage and organize the different sections of the website. React also offers a great development experience and allows for efficient updates and maintenance.
### Single-Page Design
#### I opted for a single-page design to create a seamless and intuitive browsing experience for visitors. This design choice enables users to navigate through different sections of the portfolio smoothly without having to load multiple pages.
### Responsive Design
#### Ensuring that my portfolio is accessible and looks great on various devices was a priority. I used responsive design techniques and CSS media queries to make the website adapt to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
### Video Background
#### The video background on the homepage adds an engaging visual element to the portfolio. It reflects my interest in multimedia and demonstrates my ability to incorporate creative design elements into web development projects.
### Minimalistic UI
#### I kept the user interface clean and minimalistic to maintain a professional and focused appearance. This design choice emphasizes the content and makes it easy for users to find the information they're looking for.
